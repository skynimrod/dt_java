. 1. ANT_HOME is set incorrectly or ant could not be located. Please set ANT_HOME.

  在命令行运行 ant 后, 提示上面的错误. 设置 环境变量ANT_HOME=F:\Ant 1.9.4

  原因:

      ANT_HOME 设错了.   ANT_HOME 是bin, lib 目录的父目录. 另外在环境变量Path 中添加 %ANT_HOME%\bin

      Ant 包括三个目录: bin, docs, lib.  只有bin 和lib 目录是运行Ant 所需要的.  要想安装Ant, 选择一个目录并将发行版的文件拷贝到该目录下. 这个目录才被称作ANT_HOME.

     ####

   在Eclipse 里面开发ant.

     只写了一个nint Target; 执行的时候, Eclipse 控制台输出没有Javac Target 错误. 原来是Builder.xml 执行的时候可以指定参数, 在Eclipse 里面, 右键点击Builder.xml->Run->external tools->targets 选项卡, 因为javac 被选中, 而 builder.xml 里面又没有javac Target， 所以, 把 javac 选掉就OK了。  

. 2. 在Eclipse 里面运行Ant

     右键点击 Build.xml (Ant 的构建文件) Run as -> Ant Build

     出现下面的错误:

Buildfile: D:\workspace\SpringTest0\src\cn\hxex\blog\build.xml
test:
    [mkdir] Created dir: D:\workspace\SpringTest0\src\cn\hxex\blog\${build.dir\test}
    [mkdir] Created dir: D:\workspace\SpringTest0\src\cn\hxex\blog\{build.dir\report}

BUILD FAILED
D:\workspace\SpringTest0\src\cn\hxex\blog\build.xml:23: Could not create task or type of type: junit.

Ant could not find the task or a class this task relies upon.

This is common and has a number of causes; the usual 
solutions are to read the manual pages then download and
install needed JAR files, or fix the build file: 
 - You have misspelt 'junit'.
   Fix: check your spelling.
 - The task needs an external JAR file to execute
     and this is not found at the right place in the classpath.
   Fix: check the documentation for dependencies.
   Fix: declare the task.
 - The task is an Ant optional task and the JAR file and/or libraries
     implementing the functionality were not found at the time you
     yourself built your installation of Ant from the Ant sources.
   Fix: Look in the ANT_HOME/lib for the 'ant-' JAR corresponding to the
     task and make sure it contains more than merely a META-INF/MANIFEST.MF.
     If all it contains is the manifest, then rebuild Ant with the needed
     libraries present in ${ant.home}/lib/optional/ , or alternatively,
     download a pre-built release version from apache.org
 - The build file was written for a later version of Ant
   Fix: upgrade to at least the latest release version of Ant
 - The task is not an Ant core or optional task 
     and needs to be declared using <taskdef>.
 - You are attempting to use a task defined using 
    <presetdef> or <macrodef> but have spelt wrong or not 
   defined it at the point of use

Remember that for JAR files to be visible to Ant tasks implemented
in ANT_HOME/lib, the files must be in the same directory or on the
classpath

Please neither file bug reports on this problem, nor email the
Ant mailing lists, until all of these causes have been explored,
as this is not an Ant bug.
